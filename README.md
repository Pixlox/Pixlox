# Hey! :D

I'm Omar! However, when online I usually go by *Pixlox*. My first experience with computers was at the tender age of 5, and since then, this has been my burning passion. Usually, most of my projects are private, however, some of my projects are open, here on GitHub!

I am a 14 year old High School student, too!

### Facts about me!

- I am a 14 year old student, in Sydney, Australia!
- My first language ever was Visual Basic.
- My main language right now is C#.
- I play the Guitar!
- I have a very, very, messed up sleep schedule.

### Hobbies!

My main hobby is, obviously, programming. Whenever I have some free time, I try to code. (It is hard to think of ideas though!) A big chunk of my projects are just me trying to automate things, that I really don't want to do myself. Sometimes I get the idea to create something cool, that my friends might like. Sometimes, I'm just bored, and want to make something completely random. Most of my projects are in C#, however I do use Java aswell.

Another hobby that I also greatly enjoy is Music Production! I produce music in FL Studio, and I really enjoy it. A lot of my setup is also made up of music production gear, so that also contributes to my enjoyment for it as well, I guess! Currently, I don't have any of my music published online, but when I do, I'll place some links to it. My main genres are Future Bass, EDM and Lo-Fi.

A few of my other hobbies include: Playing the Guitar, Editing using Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects and playing video games with my friends!

### What's on my desk?

**Laptop:** ***Dell Latitude 7300***
   
This laptop has served me well, and continues to. It works and performs great for everything that I do. It's great to code on, it's great to produce on, it's great to do everything on. It has 16GB of RAM and an Intel i5 8th Gen with Integrated Graphics. I'll probably upgrade this in the near future to have a general better setup.

Monitor: LG 29" UltraWide FHD HDR
This works perfectly. I have it hooked up to my laptop and my PS4, so I can switch between them easily. It works great, and, well...it's a monitor. It gets the job done, and does it well.

Microphone: Razer Seiren Mini
In my opinion, this microphone is relatively clear and of very good quality. I think it sounds it's best when used around 15cm away from your face. It's honestly a great mic that I think is very worth it. However, for music production, I am saving up to get a Audio-Technica AT2020 XLR.

Audio Interface: Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3
This Audio Interface is probably one of the most popular ones online. It serves me well, and it'll go great with the mic that I'm saving up for. I use it for general better audio quality, and also to plug in an electric guitar, if needed.

Keyboard: Razer Huntsman Mini (Clicky Purple Switches)
I've had this keyboard for ages now, and it's honestly great! I know people who despise the clicky switches on these, but I love them. With my headphones on, they're just fine. Even with them off, they're good. If you don't like clicky switches, but still want this keyboard I suggest going for the Red Switches.

Mouse: Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed
I bought this mouse as an impulse desision after my other mouse broke. It's also served me well, but what else to say about a mouse. It does it's job great, has good battery life, and it's latency is fast as well. It's also wireless, which is a perk too!

MIDI Keyboard: Novation FLKey Mini
I use this on a daily basis with FL Studio! It is honestly great, and even though it's only 25 keys, I feel that's good enough for what I'm doing now. I may upgrade to a 61 key later down the line, but to start with music production this is great!

DAW: FL Studio 20
FL Studio was my first choice when I researched about DAWs. I honestly loved it's workflow and I think it's an amazing DAW. Lifetime Free Updates is also a huge perk too! I own the Producer Edition of FL Studio for USD 199.

Headphones: Audio-Technica ATH-M20x
These headphones work for music production, just fine. They have a flat response curve so it's good for that, and they sound great as well. However, they really clamp on your head, and I can only wear them for around 4-5 hours at a time before having to take them off due to that. They also block out noise pretty well. I can't hear anything from any other rooms in my house. 

Headphones (Pair 2): Razer Blackshark V2X
This pair is mainly just meant for gaming. It also has a knob on the side for volume, which is extremely useful. This headphones response curve shows that it is extremly bassy, so I wouldn't suggest it for music production, but it is very comfy, and I can wear it for long periods of time.

Mousepad: SteelSeries QcK Edge XL
This mousepad is...a mousepad. It works well with my mouse, leaves some space for my wrist, and feels great on my hands. It works for what it does. 

Voice Assistant: Google Nest Hub
This is useful for setting timers, or asking questions or anything general. I can also use it for Netflix and other things, but my laptop works better for that, of course. I've matched my desktop wallpaper to the wallpaper on this to give my room more of a theme.
