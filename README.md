## Hey! :D

Hey, I'm Pixlox. I'm currently interested in and learning C# and a bit of Java. I am a minor, and that's all I want to disclose. I do not make many repositories, unless I want it to be public, because most of my stuff is only meant for very weird specific purposes that I want to automate, use, etc..


## Anyway...
Most of my projects here on GitHub are usually private, or I put them here because I wanted a friend to look at the code and stuff. But, when I want a project to be able to be publicly seen, and I really want it to be, you'll know it.

## My forks
My only fork right now is Brackets. I really liked Brackets and i'm sad seeing it go, but I liked the idea of having a copy of the code. So, I forked it. Just know that that fork is pretty much always going to be vanilla Brackets, so i guess, its like a mirror? I might improve on it later, but that means learning JS, and thats a whole other thing.
