## Hey! :D

Hey, I'm Pixlox. I'm currently interested in and learning C# and Haxe. I am a minor, and that's all I want to disclose. I don't have a way for you to reach me yet, but i'll work on that later.


## Anyway...
Most of my projects here on GitHub are usually private, or I put them here because I wanted a friend to look at the code and stuff. But, when I want a project to be able to be publicly seen, and I really want it to be, you'll know it.

## My forks
My only fork right now is Brackets. I really liked Brackets and i'm sad seeing it go, but I liked the idea of having a copy of the code. So, I forked it. Just know that that fork is pretty much always going to be vanilla Brackets.
