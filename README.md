# Hey! :D

I'm Omar! However, when online I usually go by *Pixlox*. My first experience with computers was at the tender age of 5, and since then, this has been my burning passion. Usually, most of my projects are private, however, some of my projects are open, here on GitHub!

I am a 14 year old High School student, too!

### Facts about me!

- I am a 14 year old student, in Sydney, Australia!
- My first language ever was Visual Basic.
- My main language(s) right now are C# and Java.
- I play the Guitar, sometimes.

### Hobbies!

My main hobby is, obviously, programming. Whenever I have some free time, I try to code. A big chunk of my projects are just me trying to automate things, that I really don't want to do myself. Sometimes I get the idea to create something cool, that my friends might like. Sometimes, I'm just bored, and want to make something completely random. Most of my projects are in C# and Java like I previously mentioned, however I've been playing around with others like JavaScript, Python, and most recently, Swift.

Another hobby that I also greatly enjoy is Music Production! I produce music in FL Studio, and I really enjoy it. A lot of my setup is also made up of music production gear, so that also contributes to my enjoyment for it as well, I guess! Currently, I don't have any of my music published online, but when I do, I'll place some links to it. My main genres that I listen to and produce are Future Bass, EDM and Lo-Fi.

### What's on my desk?

**Laptop:** ***Dell Latitude 7300***
   
This laptop has served me well, and continues to. It works and performs great for everything that I do. It's great to code on, it's great to produce on, it's great to do everything on. It has 16GB of RAM and an Intel i5 8th Gen with Integrated Graphics. This will be upgraded soon in the coming months.

**Monitor:** ***LG 29" UltraWide FHD HDR***
   
This works perfectly. I have it hooked up to my laptop and my PS4, so I can switch between them easily. It works great, and, well...it's a monitor. It gets the job done, and does it well.

**Microphone:** ***Razer Seiren Mini***
   
In my opinion, this microphone is relatively clear and of very good quality. I think it sounds it's best when used around 15cm away from your face. It's honestly a great mic that I think is very worth it. However, for music production, I am saving up to get a Audio-Technica AT2020 XLR.

**Keyboard:** ***Razer Huntsman Mini (Clicky Purple Switches)***
   
I've had this keyboard for ages now, and it's honestly great! I know people who despise the clicky switches on these, but I love them. With my headphones on, they're just fine. Even with them off, they're good. If you don't like clicky switches, but still want this keyboard I suggest going for the Red Switches.

**Mouse:** ***Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed***
   
I bought this mouse as an impulse desision after my other mouse broke. It's also served me well, but what else to say about a mouse. It does it's job great, has good battery life, and it's latency is fast as well. It's also wireless, which is a perk too!

**MIDI Keyboard:** ***Novation FLKey Mini***
   
I use this on a daily basis with FL Studio! It is honestly great, and even though it's only 25 keys, I feel that's good enough for what I'm doing now. I may upgrade to a 61 key later down the line, but to start with music production this is great!

**DAW:** ***FL Studio 21***
   
FL Studio was my first choice when I researched about DAWs. I honestly loved it's workflow and I think it's an amazing DAW. Lifetime Free Updates is also a huge perk too! I own the Producer Edition of FL Studio for USD 199.

**Headphones:** ***Audio-Technica ATH-M20x***
   
These headphones work for music production, just fine. They have a flat response curve so it's good for that, and they sound great as well. However, they really clamp on your head, and I can only wear them for around 4-5 hours at a time before having to take them off due to that. They also block out noise pretty well. I can't hear anything from any other rooms in my house. 

**Headphones (Pair 2):** ***Razer Blackshark V2X***
   
This pair is mainly just meant for gaming. It also has a knob on the side for volume, which is extremely useful. This headphones response curve shows that it is extremly bassy, so I wouldn't suggest it for music production, but it is very comfy, and I can wear it for long periods of time.
